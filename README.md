**Mathematical Programming - Simplex and Optimization**

This repository contains a collection of exercises and solutions developed during the *Mathematical Programming* course. It focuses on optimization techniques, particularly linear programming and the simplex method, with applications in decision-making and resource allocation problems. The repository also includes complementary resources for exploring advanced problem-solving using a virtual machine with WinQSB.

### Contents:
- **Linear Programming and the Simplex Method:**
  - Implemented various simplex methods to solve linear programming problems.
  - Exercises include primal and dual simplex techniques, as well as phase 1-phase 2 and Big-M methods.

- **Implementation Highlights:**
  - *Fortran Scripts:* Practical programming of linear programming algorithms (the file `practica.f90`).
  - *WinQSB Files:* Files generated using the WinQSB software, a tool for solving optimization problems.

- **Convexity and Optimization Concepts:**
  - Focused on theoretical concepts such as convexity, feasible regions, and basic and optimal solutions.

- **Duality and Sensitivity Analysis:**
  - Explored dual problems, sensitivity analysis, and post-optimization strategies to address changes in cost coefficients and constraints.

### Included Resources:
- **WinQSB Project Files:**  
  These files (`.AP_`, `.EX_`, `.AS_`, etc.) are part of optimization projects conducted using WinQSB. They can be run in a virtual machine environment to reproduce results or test variations.
